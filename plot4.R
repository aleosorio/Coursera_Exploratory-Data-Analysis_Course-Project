# PROBLEM 4
## Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related
## sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

## Answer: There are 3 types of emissions related to coal.
## Electric Generation: Went down from 937.2 to 223.1 (main source of coal by 2
##                      orders of magnitude in relation to other coal sources)
## Industrial Boilers, ICEs: Went up from 7.9 to 10.14, having peaked at around 14.8
## Comm/Institutional: Went down from 3.9 to 1.5
